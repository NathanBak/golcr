# golcr
golcr provides a golang client that can connect to the Leader and Clerk Resources on lds.org.  It is not a standalone application, but rather a package which can be used by go applications to easily read information from lds.org.

The the of client functions and data models is not complete and the model structs also may not contain fields for all available information.  Users are encouraged to augment the code as needed.  Submitting pull requests with enhancements is also encouraged.

See https://github.com/NathanBak/golcr/tree/master/examples/ for example code showing how to use the golcr client.
